Tsugi PHP Library
=================

**NOTE**: The 0.2.0 branch matches the 0.2.0 tsugi code - a frozen instance in case we need to go back.

This is under construction.  The goal is to get the Tsugi PHP library moved into 
packagist.

For now this is *not* the gold standard - it is just evolving.

Testing
---------

To test:

        php phpunit-old.phar
